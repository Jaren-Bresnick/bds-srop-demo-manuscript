### Anthony
My group worked with the Signaling Pathway Reconstruction Analysis Streamliner (SPRAS) this summer [@https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/spras].
One algorithm that we typically use to introduce SPRAS is called PathLinker [@doi:10.1038/npjsba.2016.2], which is based on shortest paths in a graph.
We also use an example cell signaling dataset to study how cells use phosphorylation as a way to communicate via chemical modifications [@pubmed:30257219].
